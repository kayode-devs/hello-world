Hello world, Its Kayode here, I'm an aspiring full stack developer and I'm learning to use Git and Github right now. 
This morning, I treid to upload a code from my system to my github account but like all newbies, I was lost.
Its 10:41pm by my time right now and I'm following the training here on github. I hope I get this soon because I'm still stuck with Javascript.
